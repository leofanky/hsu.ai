Theory of mind broadly refers to humans' ability to represent the mental states of others, including their desires, beliefs, and intentions. They propose to train a machine to build such models too. they design a Theory of Mind neural network, a ToMnet, which uses meta-learning to build models of the agents it encounters, from observations of their behaviour alone. Through this process, it acquires a strong prior model for agents' behaviour, as well as the ability to predict about agents' characteristics and mental states using only a small number of behavioural observations. It was apply the ToMnet to agents behaving in simple gridworld environments, showing that it learns to model random, algorithmic, and deep reinforcement learning agents from varied populations, and that it passes classic ToM tasks of recognising that others can hold false beliefs about the world. The article argues that this system, which autonomously learns how to model other agents in its world, is an important step forward for developing multi-agent AI systems, for building intermediating technology for machine-human interaction, and for advancing the progress on interpretable AI.
